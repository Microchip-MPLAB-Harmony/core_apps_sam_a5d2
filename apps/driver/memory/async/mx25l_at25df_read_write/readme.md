# Memory driver asynchronous -  MX25L QSPI and AT25DF SPI flash read write

This example application shows how to use the Memory driver in asynchronous mode to perform block operations on the MX25L QSPI flash and the AT25DF SPI flash media.

## Description

This application uses multi instances of the Memory driver to communicate with the AT25DF SPI flash and the MX25L QSPI flash memories in asynchronous mode of operation in both RTOS and Bare-Metal environment.

It performs block Erase/Write/Read operations on both the media.

The application consists of five tasks which are called through the SYS_Tasks() routine in Bare-Metal environment and though RTOS thread context in RTOS environment.

**DRV_MEMORY_0_Tasks()** : Manages the state machine of the Memory driver instance 0.
**DRV_MEMORY_1_Tasks()** : Manages the state machine of the Memory driver instance 1.
**APP_MX25L_Tasks()** : Performs operations on the MX25L QSPI Flash memory.
**APP_AT25DF_Tasks()** : Performs operations on the AT25DF SPI flash memory.
**APP_MONITOR_Tasks()**: Monitors the state of above two Tasks.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a5d2_xult.X <br> sam_a5d2_xult_freertos.X <br> sam_a5d2_xult_freertos_iar.IAR <br> sam_a5d2_xult_iar.IAR | [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT) |

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Make sure that the jumper JP9 is removed (jumper pins are not shorted)

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED is turned ON when the data read from each media matches with the data written in them

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
