# USART driver asynchronous - USART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in Bare-Metal environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Setting up the board

- Connect a FTDI cable from UART Debug (J28) port to computer.
- Connect the USB_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
3. Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:

    ![output_async_usart_echo](images/output_async_usart_echo.png)

5. LED toggles each time the character is echoed

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
