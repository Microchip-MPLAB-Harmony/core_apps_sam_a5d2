# SPI Driver asynchronous - Self loopback multi client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients.

## Description

- This example writes and reads back the same data (self loop back) for two different clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver

- It uses the request (write and read request) queuing feature of the asynchronous driver and does not waste CPU bandwidth in waiting for previous request completion

- The example also demonstrates how to setup two different client transfers at different baud rates

- This example performs self loop back only once after a power on reset
- Success is indicated when a successful self loop back is reported by both the clients
- After the loop back test is complete, the application remains in the idle state

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/at91bootstrap/blob/master/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- Use jumper wire to Connect "Pin 16 of EXT1 header" to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI1 MOSI signal is mapped to PD26 that is routed to "Pin 16 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI1 MISO signal is mapped to PD27 that is routed to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED is turned ON on Success

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
