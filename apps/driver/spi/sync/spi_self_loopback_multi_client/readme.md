# SPI Driver synchronous - Self loopback multi client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in synchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients in RTOS environment.

## Description

- This example writes and reads back the same data (self loop back) for two different clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of a synchronous SPI driver

- The example also demonstrates how to setup two different client transfers at two different baud rates

- The example has three RTOS threads for the purpose:
  - **APP_CLIENT1_Tasks:**
    - This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer
    - If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms
    - In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself
  - **APP_CLIENT2_Tasks:**
    - This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer
    - If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms
    - In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself
  - **APP_MONITOR_Tasks:**
    - This thread checks the status of loop back done by the two client tasks and turns on the LED if the loop back transfer status reported by both the clients is successful

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a5d2_xult_freertos.X <br> sam_a5d2_xult_freertos_iar.IAR/spi_self_loopback_multi_client_freertos_sam_a5d2_xult_freertos.eww/spi_self_loopback_multi_client_freertos_sam_a5d2_xult_freertos.eww | [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT) |

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult_freertos.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- Use jumper wire to Connect "Pin 16 of EXT1 header" to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI1 MOSI signal is mapped to PD26 that is routed to "Pin 16 of EXT1 header"
  - SPI1 MISO signal is mapped to PD27 that is routed to "Pin 17 of EXT1 header"
- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED is turned ON on Success

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
