# SDMMC driver asynchronous - SDMMC Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode to perform block operations on the SD Card Media.

## Description

- This example uses the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environment to perform Block Erase/Write/Read operations on SD-Card
- This application writes 60KB (61440 bytes) of data starting at the SD Card memory location 0x2000
- It then reads and verifies the written data

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD Card matches with the written data

*NOTE: This demo application performs a raw read-write operation on the SD card. This causes the partition information to be overwritten causing the SD card file system to be corrupted. Hence resetting the board will not re-run the application demo (Board will fail to boot since it cannot find a valid partition). To repeat the demo we need to reformat SD card and prepare it as defined by the hardware setup.*

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
