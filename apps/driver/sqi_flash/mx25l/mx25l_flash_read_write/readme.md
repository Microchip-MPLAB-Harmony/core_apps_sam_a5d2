# SQI flash MX25L driver - MX25L SQI read write

This example application shows how to use the MX25L QSPI flash driver to perform block operations on the on-board MX25L QSPI Flash memory.

## Description

This application uses the MX25L QSPI flash driver to Erase/Write/Read on the On-Board MX25L QSPI Flash memory using the QSPI peripheral library.The application consists of APP_Tasks() which is called through SYS_Tasks() routine.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a5d2_xult.X <br> sam_a5d2_xult_iar.IAR/mx25lx_flash_read_write_sam_a5d2_xult.eww/mx25lx_flash_read_write_sam_a5d2_xult.eww | [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT) |

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Make sure that the jumper JP9 is removed (jumper pins are not shorted)

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED indicates the success or failure.
    - LED toggles with 1 second delay if the demo executes successfully
    - LED turns on and stays on if the demo executes with error

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
