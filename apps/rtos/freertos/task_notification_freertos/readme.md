# FreeRTOS Task Notification

This example application is to illustrate the FreeRTOS Task Notification feature which is used as a light weight binary semaphore.

## Description

- This demonstration creates two tasks that send notifications back and forth to each other.
  - Task2 blocks to wait for Task1 to notify and will be blocked for 500ms
  - Task1 sends a notification to Tasks2, bringing it out of the blocked state, toggles an LED
  - Task1 blocks to wait for Task2 to notify
  - Task2 sends notification to Task1, bringing it out of the blocked state

- Above steps will be repeated. i.e. an LED toggles for every 500ms

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/rtos/freertos/task_notification_freertos/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a5d2_xult.X <br> sam_a5d2_xult_iar.IAR/task_notification_freertos_sam_a5d2_xult.eww/task_notification_freertos_sam_a5d2_xult.eww | [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT) |

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. The LED toggles on success for every 500ms

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)  | RGB_LED(Blue) |
