# FAT filesystem using SST26 Media

This application shows an example of using the FAT File System to access SQI based SST26 flash media

## Description

### File System Operations on the On-Board SST26 Flash Memory:

- Performs a SYS_FS_FormatDisk
- Opens a **newfile.txt** on the SST26 flash
- Write and reads back 4KB of data on **newfile.txt**
- Verifies the Data Read back

### File system layer uses:

- One instance of the Memory driver is used to communicate with the On-Board SQI Flash memory

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a5d2_curiosity.X <br> sam_a5d2_curiosity_freertos.X | [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A) |

### Setting up [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)

- Connect the SQI Boot Jumper (J10).
- Connect the USB_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON if data has successfully been written and read back from file "newfile.txt"

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
