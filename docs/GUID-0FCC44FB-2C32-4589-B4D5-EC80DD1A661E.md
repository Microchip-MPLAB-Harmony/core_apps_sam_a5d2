# SPI EEPROM AT25 Driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT25 driver to perform read and write<br /> operations on AT25 series of EEPROM.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example uses the AT25 driver to communicate with the SPI based AT25 series of<br /> external EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   [EEPROM 4 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Install an [EEPROM 4 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) board on the MikroBus1 \(J19\) header
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a USB-C cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON when the value read from EEPROM matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:
