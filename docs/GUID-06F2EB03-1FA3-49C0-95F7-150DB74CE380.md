## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect a FTDI cable from UART Debug \(J28\) port to computer.
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:
