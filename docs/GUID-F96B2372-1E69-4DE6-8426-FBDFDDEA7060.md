# SDMMC Driver Asynchronous - SDMMC Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode to<br /> perform block operations on the SD Card Media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

-   This example uses the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environment to perform Block Erase/Write/Read operations on SD-Card.
-   This application writes 60KB \(61440 bytes\) of data starting at the SD Card memory location 0x2000.
-   It then reads and verifies the written data.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   SD Card with FAT32 file system

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Insert SD Card in ÂµSD BOOT \(J6\) slot. SDMMC0 is configured for testing in application
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD Card matches with the written data

    **Note:** *This demo application performs a raw read-write operation on the SD card. This causes the partition information to be overwritten causing the SD card file system to be corrupted. Hence resetting the board will not re-run the application demo \(Board will fail to boot since it cannot find a valid partition\). To repeat the demo we need to reformat SD card and prepare it as defined by the hardware setup.*
