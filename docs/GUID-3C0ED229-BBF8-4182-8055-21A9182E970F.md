# USART Driver Synchronous - USART Multi Instance

This example echoes the received characters over the two consoles using the USART driver<br /> in synchronous mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in synchronous mode RTOS environments to<br /> communicate over two consoles. It receives and echoes back the characters entered by<br /> the user on the respective console.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   [USB UART CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect a FTDI cable from UART Debug \(J28\) port to computer.

-   Connect [USB UART CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board to<br /> the curiosity board using the pin connections described below:

    |SAM A5D2 curiosity board Pins|USB UART Click board Pins|
    |-----------------------------|-------------------------|
    |PIN 5, J8 connector|RX|
    |PIN 4, J8 connector|TX|
    |PIN 7, J19 connector|3.3V|
    |PIN 1, J8 connector|GND|

-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type<br /> cable


## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer for both ports
3.  Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  Type ten characters and observe the output on the two consoles as shown below:
    -   If success, when ten characters are typed it will be echoed back on the console and LED is toggled every time the characters are echoed
    -   **Console 1**
