# FAT Filesystem using SQI Flash Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access SQI<br /> based flash media. The SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board, SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1 and the SAMA5D27-WLSOM1-EK1 have the SST26 flash media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

### File System Operations on the On-Board SQI Flash Memory

-   Performs a SYS\_FS\_FormatDisk
-   Opens a **newfile.txt** on the flash memory
-   Write and reads back 4KB of data on **newfile.txt**
-   Verifies the Data Read back

### File system layer uses the following components:

-   One instance of the Memory driver is used to communicate with the On-Board SQI Flash memory

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect the SQI Boot Jumper \(J10\)
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1

-   Connecting a micro-USB cable to J10 both powers the board as well as provides a virtual COM port to open a serial terminal

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-WLSOM1-EK1

-   Connect a USB to UART FTDI cable to J26 \(DEBUG FTDI\) to open a serial terminal
-   Connecting a micro-USB cable to J10 powers the board
-   Press the SW3 \(nSTART\_SOM\) button to power the ATSAMA5D27-WLSOM1 System-On-Module

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON if data has successfully been written and read back from file â€œnewfile.txtâ€?

Refer to the following table for LED name:
