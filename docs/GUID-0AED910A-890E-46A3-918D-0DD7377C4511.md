# Time System Service Multi-client

This example application demonstrates the multi-client system timer functionality.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

-   This application demonstrates timer functionality \(with two clients to the Time System Service\) by periodically printing a message on console every two seconds and blinking an LED every one second.
-   Delay, counter and single shot timer functionality is demonstrated on a switch press.
-   On a switch press, the application reads the current value of the 64 bit counter \(say, count 1\).
-   It then starts a delay of 500 milliseconds and waits for the delay to expire.
-   Once the delay has expired, the application again reads the current value of the 64 bit counter \(say, count 2\) and calculates the difference between the two counter values.
-   The difference count indicates the time spent for the delay and is printed on the console as, â€œDelay time = x msâ€?, where x is the delay value and is equal to 500 milliseconds in the given example.
-   The application then starts a single shot timer of 100 milliseconds.
-   When the single shot timer expires, a message is printed on the console that says â€œSingle shot timer of 100 ms expiredâ€?.
-   This message is printed only once on every switch press.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect a FTDI cable from UART Debug \(J28\) port to computer.
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  Reset the board to run the application
5.  Observe the following message getting printed on the console every two seconds

    ![](GUID-2B087BDF-602F-4E99-AA55-C034842F3545-low.png)

6.  Press the switch and observe the following output on the terminal \(highlighted in red box\)

    ![](GUID-F13437CC-8879-452C-A5A9-532058BFEB56-low.png)

    -   **Delay time = 500 ms** indicates the amount of time spent during the delay
    -   **Single shot timer of 100 ms expired** is printed only once on every switch press
7.  LED indicates the periodic timer functionality
    -   LED is toggled periodically every one second

Refer to the following table for Switch and LED names:
