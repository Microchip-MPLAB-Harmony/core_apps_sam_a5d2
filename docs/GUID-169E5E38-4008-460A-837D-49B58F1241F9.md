# SPI Driver Asynchronous - Multi Client

This example demonstrates how to use single instance of the SPI driver in asynchronous<br /> mode to communicate with multiple EEPROMs.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example write and read data to and from two separate EEPROM connected over the<br /> same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of the driver. The example also<br /> demonstrates how to setup two different EEPROM transfers at different baud<br /> rates.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   Two [EEPROM 4 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) boards

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Install [EEPROM 4 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) boards on to the "MikroBus1 \(J19\)" and "MikroBus2 \(J22\)" connectors
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  The LED turns ON when the data read from the EEPROMs matches with the data written to the EEPROMs.

Refer to the following table for LED name:
