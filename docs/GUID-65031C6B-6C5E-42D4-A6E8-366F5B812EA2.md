# Memory Driver Asynchronous - SST26 QSPI Flash Read Write

This example application shows how to use the Memory driver in asynchronous mode of<br /> operation in both RTOS and Bare-Metal environment on the SST26 QSPI flash media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This application uses Memory driver to communicate with the SST26 QSPI flash memories<br /> in asynchronous mode of operation in Bare-Metal environment and RTOS<br /> environment.

It performs block Erase/Write/Read operations on QSPI flash media.

The application consists of three tasks which are called through the SYS\_Tasks\(\)<br /> routine in Bare-Metal environment and though RTOS thread context in RTOS<br /> environment.

**DRV\_MEMORY\_0\_Tasks\(\)**: Manages the state machine of the Memory driver instance<br /> 0.

**APP\_SST26\_Tasks\(\)**: Performs operations on the SST26 QSPI Flash memory.

**APP\_MONITOR\_Tasks\(\)**: Monitors the state of above Task.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.
-   Make sure that the jumper J10 is connected

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  LED is turned ON when the data read from each media matches with the data written in them

Refer to the following table for LED name:
