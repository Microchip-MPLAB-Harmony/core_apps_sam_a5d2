# Memory Driver Synchronous - SST26 QSPI Flash Read Write

This example application shows how to use the Memory driver in synchronous mode to<br /> perform block operations on the SST26 QSPI flash media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This application uses multi instances of the Memory driver to communicate with the<br /> SST26 QSPI Flash memory in synchronous mode of operation in RTOS Environment. It<br /> performs block Erase/Write/Read operations on the flash media. The application<br /> consists of two tasks which are called in the RTOS thread context:

**APP\_SST26\_Tasks\(\)** : Performs operations on the SST26 QSPI/SQI Flash<br /> Memory.

**APP\_MONITOR\_Tasks\(\)**: Monitors the state of above two Tasks.

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its<br /> IDE.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_a5d2\_curiosity\_freertos.X|MPLABX project for [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.
-   Make sure that the jumper J10 is connected

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  LED blinks when the data read from memory matches with the data written in it.

Refer to the following table for LED name:
