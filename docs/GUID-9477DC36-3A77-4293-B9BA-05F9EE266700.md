# I2C Driver Asynchronous - I2C EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to perform<br /> operations on the EEPROM.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example uses the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with the EEPROM<br /> to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment. This application<br /> uses I2C driver to read and write data from an on-Board AT24MAC402 EEPROM<br /> device.

## Downloading and Building the Application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_a5d2) and then<br /> click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

Path of the application within the repository is<br /> **apps/driver/i2c/async/i2c\_eeprom/firmware**.

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its<br /> IDE.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_a5d2\_curiosity\_freertos.X|MPLABX project for [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect the [EEPROM 3 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) to the MikroBus1 \(J19\) header of the [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:
