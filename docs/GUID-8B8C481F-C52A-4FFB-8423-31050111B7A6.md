# FAT Filesystem using SDMMC Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access and<br /> modify the contents of a SD card using the SDMMC driver.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

### File System Operations on the SD Card:

-   Application opens a file named **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** in the root directory of the SD card and reads its content into memory.
    -   The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG \(image\) file chosen by the user and then renamed to **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG**.
-   Application creates directory named **Dir1** in the root directory.
-   Application creates a new file named **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** inside **Dir1**.
-   Application copies the content from step 1 into this newly created file.

The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file,<br /> **Dir1/FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** created by the demonstration<br /> could be easily verified for correctness. If the new file inside **Dir1**<br /> opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is<br /> deemed to have passed. Otherwise, if the file does not open \(i.e., is<br /> corrupted\), the test will be considered to have failed.

**Note:** *Since the application creates a directory named Dir1, it is important that the a folder with the same name does not exist on the SD card. If a directory named Dir1 is already present on the SD card, the application will fail.*

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.
