## Description

-   This demonstration creates two tasks that send notifications back and forth to each other.
    -   Task2 blocks to wait for Task1 to notify and will be blocked for 50 0ms
    -   Task1 sends a notification to Tasks2, bringing it out of the blocked state, toggles an LED
    -   Task1 blocks to wait for Task2 to notify
    -   Task2 sends notification to Task1, bringing it out of the blocked state
-   Above steps will be repeated. i.e., an LED toggles for every 500 ms
