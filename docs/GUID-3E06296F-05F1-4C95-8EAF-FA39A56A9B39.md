# SST26 SQI Flash Driver - Flash read write in SPI mode

This example application shows how to use the SST26 driver to perform block operations on<br /> the On-Board SST26 Flash memory in SPI mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This application uses the SST26 driver to Erase/Write/Read on the On-Board SST26<br /> Flash memory using the SQI peripheral library configured in SPI mode. The<br /> application consists of APP\_SST26\_Tasks\(\) which is called through SYS\_Tasks\(\)<br /> routine.

## Downloading and Building the Application

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_a5d2\_curiosity.X|MPLABX project for [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

-   Connect the SQI Boot Jumper \(J10\).
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a USB-C cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  LED is turned ON when the data read from SST26 flash matches with the data written in it

Refer to the following table for LED name:
