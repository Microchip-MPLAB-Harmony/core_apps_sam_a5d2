# Building AT91Bootstrap Project Using MPLABx

-   Open a console and execute the following command to clone at91bootstrap repository into a directory named at91bootstrap.X

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_TXH_CYD_ZZB}
    git clone https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap at91bootstrap.X
    
    ```

-   Open at91bootstrap.X directory as project in MPLABx

## Configure Compiler

    **Note:** *For the build to be successful, the configured compiler should be available in the system path.*


## Configure Target

-   Open project properties window, and choose **Kconfig** option to configure the build target:

-   Click on **LOAD** button and navigate to the configs folder inside at91bootstrap.X directory. You need to choose the default configuration file\(defconfig\) based on what you need the at91boostrap to do

    **Debug/Run application from within MPLABx**

    -   Load *\{evaluation\_kit\}\_bkpt\_none\_defconfig*. For example, on SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board, select **sama5d29\_Curiosity\_bkptnone\_defconfig** as the configuration file
    -   Click on **Apply** and **OK** buttons to configure the project

        ![](GUID-87D51264-9135-4262-BFB7-2DCE0E5742A0-low.png)

    -   You can see that the MPU product is now selected as **SAMA5D2** and the primary operation is selected as **Configure and Stop**
    **Load and Run application from an SD card**

    -   Load *\{evaluation\_kit\}sd\_uboot\_defconfig*. For example, on SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board, select **sama5d29\_Curiositysd\_uboot\_defconfig** as the configuration file
    -   Click on **Apply** and **OK** buttons to configure the project

        ![](GUID-DEDD0212-268F-4C32-88A7-FC352E0B8955-low.png)

    -   You can see that the MPU product is now selected as **SAMA5D2** and the primary operation is selected as **Load and launch next software**
    -   Edit the Option **Next Software Image File Name** from *u-boot.bin* to *harmony.bin*

## Build Target

Once the target configuration is applied in the properties window, you can build the<br /> at91boostrap just like any other MPLABx project. After the build is complete, you<br /> can find the generated binary files under build/binaries directory.
