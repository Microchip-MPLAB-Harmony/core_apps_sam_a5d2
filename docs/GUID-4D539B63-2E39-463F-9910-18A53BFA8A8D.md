# SDSPI Driver Asynchronous - SDSPI Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDSPI driver in asynchronous mode to<br /> perform block operations on the SD Card Media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example uses the SDSPI driver in asynchronous mode. The asynchronous mode of the<br /> SDSPI driver performs non-blocking read and write operations. The SDSPI driver is<br /> configured to use DMA.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   SD Card with FAT32 file system
-   [Micro-SD click board](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click)

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Insert SD Card in the [Micro-SD click board](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click) card slot.
-   Connect the [Micro-SD click board](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click) to MikroBus1 \(J19\) connector
-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable.

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD card matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:
