# I2C EEPROM AT24 Driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write<br /> operations on AT24 series of EEPROM.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver and System Service Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-89743DCD-F235-4D2D-AE19-B9D1B98911AD.md)

## Description

This example uses the AT24 driver to communicate with I2C based External AT24CM0<br /> series EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal/ RTOS<br /> environment.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-EC647FFE-720B-413C-81C5-6ACA67E7CC7B.md) for details on how to<br /> configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the<br /> application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDTIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the USB\_A port on board to the computer using a USB-C type cable
-   Connect EEPROM Click 3 Board to MikroBus1 \(J19\) connector on the board as per below Pin Connections table

    |J19 MikroBus1 Pins|EEPROM 3 CLICK Pins|
    |------------------|-------------------|
    |PIN 11 \(PD4\)|SDA|
    |PIN 12 \(PD5\)|SCL|
    |PIN 19|GND|
    |PIN 20|3V3|


## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    -   LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:
